\section{Hazard Models with AFT parametrization}
\subsection{Key Concepts and Framework}
Using a hazard model for interval-censored survival data with an accelerated failure-time (AFT) parameterization, like \cite{albuquerque2024market}, we will be able to examine how farmers' expectations of the temporal movement of buyer competitiveness, price expectations, logistical factors, and external conditions influence their marketing timing.

Some concepts are explained below:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Hazard Model: A hazard model, or survival model, can analyze and predict the time until an event of interest occurs. It was firstly developed and applied in disciplines like medicine and public health, which is the origin of its name. 
    \item AFT: AFT parameterization models assume that the effect of covariates is to accelerate or decelerate the survival (marketing/storage in our case) time by a constant factor. For example, a covariate with a positive coefficient may prolong the survival (marketing) time, while a negative effect may shorten it.
    \item Interval censoring: it arises when the event timing is only known to fall within certain bounds. This requires specialized statistical methods to estimate durations and their determinants accurately. 
\end{itemize}



\subsubsection{Hazard Model with AFT Parameterization}
The hazard model describes the likelihood (hazard rate) of selling apples at a specific time, conditional on not having sold them earlier. The AFT framework reinterprets the model by focusing on factors accelerating or delaying the time to sell.

The hazard rate for farmer $f$ selling apples $c$ at time $t_{c,f}$ is:
$$
    h_j(t_{c,f}) = h_0(t_{c,f}) \exp\left(-\mathbf{x}_{c,f} \boldsymbol{\beta}\right),
$$
where we could assume that $h_0(t) = \alpha t^{\alpha-1}$ follows a Weibull distribution, and $\mathbf{x}_{c,f}$ includes explanatory variables.

The survivor function $S_j(t)$, which represents the probability of not selling by time $t$, satisfies $h_j(t) = -\frac{d \log S_j(t)}{dt}. $

For our interval-censored data, the model's likelihood function is:
$$
    \mathcal{L} = \prod_{j=1}^N \left(S_j(t_{i-1}) h(t_i)\right)^{y_{j,i-1}} S_j(t_{i-1})^{1-y_{j,i}},
$$
where $y_{j,i} = 1$ if the sale occurs within the interval $i$.

Our empirical specification includes a township fixed effect to control for unobserved location-specific factors, such as local weather, road conditions, and market infrastructure and access. This township fixed effect improves the model’s ability to account for local heterogeneity but may reduce estimation efficiency due to limited observations within some townships.


\subsection{Results}
\input{Tables/Weibull_Survival_Model_basic}

In the full sample, our Weibull survival estimates indicate that positive market competitive expectations (i.e., anticipating more buyers in the future) are a key driver of longer storage durations (0.499). This suggests that farmers who foresee stronger future demand tend to retain their crops to secure higher prices or more favorable trading terms. By contrast, pessimistic market expectations about future buyers do not significantly affect storage decisions, indicating an asymmetric response where optimism exerts a stronger influence than caution.

Local infrastructure also exerts a prominent effect. The \textit{distance to small storage facilities} has a strong, negative impact on storage duration (-0.301). Farmers located farther from such facilities face higher transport and time costs, which likely discourages them from storing for extended periods. Conversely, \textit{distance to large storage facilities} shows no significant effect, underscoring the importance of proximity to smaller, community-level storage options.

Among the strategic considerations, farmers storing for \textit{broader marketing opportunities} (0.327) or \textit{using storage as a bargaining tool} (0.273) tend to keep their crops longer. Furthermore, education and number of current buyers also increase storage duration (0.100 and 0.029, respectively). These findings suggest that better-informed farmers and those with diverse buyer networks have greater incentives—and the requisite capacity—to store crops until they find more advantageous selling conditions.

In the subsample of dedicated storage users, different patterns emerge. Here, \textit{negative market expectations} about future buyers' competitiveness demonstrate a marginally significant negative effect (-0.211), while positive expectations lose significance. This implies that storage users—likely more risk-averse or heavily invested—are especially sensitive to potential market downturns. Moreover, a \textit{broader buyer network} retains a marginally significant, positive effect on storage duration (0.043), yet strategic motivations such as marketing and bargaining do not yield significant effects within this group. These differences suggest that dedicated storage users might be influenced by factors beyond our current model, including capacity, financing constraints, or established buyer relationships.
