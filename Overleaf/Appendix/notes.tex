\section{Important Notes}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Cartel Solution:} Cartel solution is NOT an NE for any static game, but it may be NE behavior in any single play of an infinite-horizon repeated game. (by Folk Theorem)
    
    \item \textbf{Why Cournot, instead of Bertrand?} Analogy to \cite{kreps1983quantity}, I can infer that when traders simultaneously and independently receive "downstream orders" for subsequent distribution, and I assume that the capacity level (the quantity of the downstream orders) are public information and traders compete in Bertrand-like price competition, with the supply allocated in Bertrand fashion where the provision that one cannot satisfy more supply than one's order from downstream in the first stage: \\
    "Capacity introduced + Bertrand" $\Longleftrightarrow$ "Cournot".

    \item \textbf{Supply Elasticity:} the village supply to this model should be elastic in both periods, but differ in two periods because farmers have the "outside" selling options differently. 
\end{enumerate}
