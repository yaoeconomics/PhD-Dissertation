\section{Empirical Evidence}

\noindent Our empirical analysis integrates farmers' trading records, subjective market expectations, and objective measures of time-varying competition to examine the role of storage in improving smallholder welfare. Specifically, it investigates how storage enables inter-temporal arbitrage, allowing farmers to sell in more competitive farm-gate oligopsonistic markets—an aspect often overlooked in smallholder market research.

Existing observational data are insufficient, as micro-surveys typically capture post-trade information (e.g., transaction prices, storage volumes) but lack measures of temporal market competitiveness, such as buyer visits and price offer frequency after harvest. Thus, a survey-based approach is necessary to assess how storage decisions and local procurement market structures shape farmer bargaining power.

This study surveys both farmers and middlemen in a Central China county where Fuji apple cultivation dominates. Given the region's reliance on a single cash crop and the strategic role of cold storage in marketing decisions, it provides an ideal setting to analyze the interaction between storage and market competition.

\subsection{Field Site: a County in Central China}
\noindent Yanchang County, Shaanxi province, China (see Figure \ref{Figure: Yanchang}), serves as an ideal location to study farmers' marketing and storage decisions. The county is home to numerous small-scale farmers who heavily rely on a single cash crop, primarily Fuji apples, for their livelihoods. Each village within the county possesses a central market where farmers sell their produce, attracting middlemen and traders. Cold storage facilities are also available for farmers to rent or purchase, providing them with access to these inputs. In 2024, the fruit storage facilities in the entire county can accommodate up to 180,000 tons of fresh apples, with most of the capacity utilized in a given year.

\begin{figure}[thp]

\end{figure}

The apple farmers in Yanchang County predominantly cultivate late-maturing Fuji apples, which constitute approximately 85-90\% of the production. Some farmers also grow mid-maturing apples (5-10\%) and early-maturing apples (around 5\%). Farm-gate prices range from 2.5 to 12 yuan/kg and can be checked regularly. The yield per acre does not significantly differ among the three apple varieties.

Although there are over 260 villages in the county, the average number of fruit storage facilities is slightly over 100, meaning that there is less than one facility per administrative village. Cold storage facilities owned by apple growers in Yanchang County can be classified into two types: small-scale facilities capable of storing up to 50 tons and medium-sized facilities with a capacity of up to 500 tons. According to the government report, only 1.3\% of farmers possess their own small-scale cold storage facilities. However, many farmers rent cold storage facilities established by the township and large merchants. It is worth noting that the quality of fruit storage facilities constructed by township governments is subpar compared to those built by farmers themselves. Farmers contribute 60\% of the investment, while the government subsidizes the remaining 40\%.

Farmers in Yanchang County who do not adopt cold storage facilities have to sell their harvest within a month. On the other hand, farmers using cold storage facilities need to consider various factors and market conditions, including the time-varying competition among traders. With cold storage, they can market their produce until April or May of the following year without significant deterioration. Furthermore, they are not necessarily limited to selling to middlemen but also sometimes do retail selling to consumers directly, as storage facilities grant them temporal flexibility to find more potential buyers.

\subsection{Data}
\subsubsection{Sampling Procedure}
\noindent This study employs empirical tests using data collected from two rounds of a survey of 615 smallholder apple growers in Yanchang County, Central China, covering the 2024/2025 agricultural season. With Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, the survey was conducted between October 10, 2024, and December 13, 2024. Given that the harvest season for Fuji apples in Central China concludes in mid-to-late October, followed immediately by the lean season, this period provides a relevant timeframe to analyze the evolving market conditions faced by farmers.

The survey was conducted in collaboration with the Yanchang-County Women's Federation (YWF), an organization responsible for public welfare and rural development in Yanchang County. In coordination with the Yanchang County Agricultural Bureau, the YWF facilitated access to micro-level data on apple growers, enabling a structured sampling approach. A one-layer stratified random sampling method was employed based on geographical location. Yanchang County consists of one urban subdistrict and seven rural towns. To ensure representativeness, the Yanchang County Agricultural Bureau determined the approximate sampling proportion for each town based on the number and density of fruit farmers (30\%:15\%:15\%:15\%:10\%:5\%:5\%:5\%). Following these proportions, smallholder apple-growing households were randomly selected from rosters provided by administrative villages within each town.

For the purpose of this study, smallholder apple growers are defined as farmers who cultivate no more than 50 mu of land and derive at least 90\% of their agricultural income from apple production. Additionally, to maintain sufficient sample sizes across towns, a minimum of 10 participating apple growers was ensured in each town, though no minimum was imposed at the village level.

The survey targeted farmers whose primary source of income is derived from growing red Fuji apples. The interviews were conducted with the household head, except in cases where the household head was elderly and no longer part of the active labor force. In such instances, the survey was conducted with the primary labor force member of the household.



\subsubsection{Measurements of Farmers' Storage Usage and Procurement Competitiveness}
\noindent The survey examined apple growers' cold storage usage and marketing timing decisions as our key dependent variables. First, \texttt{Storage-Usage-Binary} is a binary variable indicating whether a farmer used cold storage at harvest, taking a value of 1 if storage was used and 0 otherwise. Second, \texttt{Storage-Usage-Type} further categorizes storage choices into four groups: \textit{Not\_use} (no storage, corresponding to $Storage\_Usage\_Binary = 0$), and \textit{Rent\_large}, \textit{Rent\_small}, or \textit{Self\_built} (all indicating some form of storage, corresponding to $Storage\_Usage\_Binary = 1$). Third, \texttt{Time-to-Sell} represents the delay between harvest and sale, identically saying "the storage time". I classified sales occurring in October to a time-to-sell of 1--4 weeks post-harvest, November to 5--8 weeks, and so forth, creating interval-censored data where the exact selling time is known only within predefined intervals (1--4, 5--8, 9--12, or 13--28 weeks). The distribution of selling weeks group by storage type is depicted in Figure \ref{Figure: selling weeks distribution}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{figures/selling_weeks_distribution.png}
\caption{Selling Weeks Distribution}
\label{Figure: selling weeks distribution}
\end{figure}

To capture inter-temporal variations in oligopsony power among buyers, farmers were asked to report:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Their subjective perceptions of the level of buyer competition at harvest time (\texttt{Subjective buyer competitiveness}: ranging from 1 to 5);
    \item Their expectations regarding changes in the number of traders over the subsequent three months (i.e., from October 2024 onward, denoted as \texttt{Expect more buyers} and \texttt{Expect fewer buyers}).
\end{enumerate}

The survey collected data on smallholder farmers' total annual agricultural income, production costs, storage costs, and other demographic characteristics to assess their welfare implications.

To complement the farmer survey with market-level insights, an additional buyer survey was conducted in December 2024, targeting 15 buyers, including the top five most influential local traders. These buyers were asked to:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Identify the specific villages they had visited during the October harvest;
    \item Report the cold storage facilities they had procured from over the past two months.
\end{enumerate}
As \cite{macchiavello2021competition} illustrated the number of mills within a 10 km radius from the mill as the baseline measure of competition, the two measures above allow me to create an objective assessment of the \texttt{Number of buyers} visiting each village during the post-harvest period, providing an objective measure of buyer concentration and inter-temporal competition.

\subsection{Descriptive Statistics}
\noindent We have valid complete data for 549 smallholder apple-growing household observations, which would serve as our full sample. Of these, 200 farmers store their produce in either their self-built cold storage facilities or small- and large-scale commercial cold storage facilities in the 2024-2025 agricultural year. They would serve as a main sub-sample for us to analyze the behavior of storage users. 

Table \ref{} presents summary statistics on Time to sell and Expected price growth, the expected price level and the sales price (both in logarithms due to skewness in the price levels), as well as other variables from the survey used in this study.

\subsection{Hazard Models with AFT parametrization}
\subsubsection{Key Concepts and Framework}
Using a hazard model for interval-censored survival data with an accelerated failure-time (AFT) parameterization, like \cite{albuquerque2024market}, we will be able to examine how farmers' expectations of the temporal movement of buyer competitiveness, price expectations, logistical factors, and external conditions influence their marketing timing.

Some concepts are explained below:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Hazard Model: A hazard model, or survival model, can analyze and predict the time until an event of interest occurs. It was firstly developed and applied in disciplines like medicine and public health, which is the origin of its name. 
    \item AFT: AFT parameterization models assume that the effect of covariates is to accelerate or decelerate the survival (marketing/storage in our case) time by a constant factor. For example, a covariate with a positive coefficient may prolong the survival (marketing) time, while a negative effect may shorten it.
    \item Interval censoring: it arises when the event timing is only known to fall within certain bounds. This requires specialized statistical methods to estimate durations and their determinants accurately. 
\end{itemize}



\subsubsection{Hazard Model with AFT Parameterization}
The hazard model describes the likelihood (hazard rate) of selling apples at a specific time, conditional on not having sold them earlier. The AFT framework reinterprets the model by focusing on factors accelerating or delaying the time to sell.

The hazard rate for farmer $f$ selling apples $c$ at time $t_{c,f}$ is:
$$
    h_j(t_{c,f}) = h_0(t_{c,f}) \exp\left(-\mathbf{x}_{c,f} \boldsymbol{\beta}\right),
$$
where we could assume that $h_0(t) = \alpha t^{\alpha-1}$ follows a Weibull distribution, and $\mathbf{x}_{c,f}$ includes explanatory variables.

The survivor function $S_j(t)$, which represents the probability of not selling by time $t$, satisfies $h_j(t) = -\frac{d \log S_j(t)}{dt}. $

For our interval-censored data, the model's likelihood function is:
$$
    \mathcal{L} = \prod_{j=1}^N \left(S_j(t_{i-1}) h(t_i)\right)^{y_{j,i-1}} S_j(t_{i-1})^{1-y_{j,i}},
$$
where $y_{j,i} = 1$ if the sale occurs within the interval $i$.

Our empirical specification includes a township fixed effect to control for unobserved location-specific factors, such as local weather, road conditions, and market infrastructure and access. This township fixed effect improves the model’s ability to account for local heterogeneity but may reduce estimation efficiency due to limited observations within some townships.


\subsubsection{Results}
\input{tables/Weibull_Survival_Model_basic}

In the full sample, our Weibull survival estimates indicate that positive market competitive expectations (i.e., anticipating more buyers in the future) are a key driver of longer storage durations (0.499). This suggests that farmers who foresee stronger future demand tend to retain their crops to secure higher prices or more favorable trading terms. By contrast, pessimistic market expectations about future buyers do not significantly affect storage decisions, indicating an asymmetric response where optimism exerts a stronger influence than caution.

Local infrastructure also exerts a prominent effect. The \textit{distance to small storage facilities} has a strong, negative impact on storage duration (-0.301). Farmers located farther from such facilities face higher transport and time costs, which likely discourages them from storing for extended periods. Conversely, \textit{distance to large storage facilities} shows no significant effect, underscoring the importance of proximity to smaller, community-level storage options.

Among the strategic considerations, farmers storing for \textit{broader marketing opportunities} (0.327) or \textit{using storage as a bargaining tool} (0.273) tend to keep their crops longer. Furthermore, education and number of current buyers also increase storage duration (0.100 and 0.029, respectively). These findings suggest that better-informed farmers and those with diverse buyer networks have greater incentives—and the requisite capacity—to store crops until they find more advantageous selling conditions.

In the subsample of dedicated storage users, different patterns emerge. Here, \textit{negative market expectations} about future buyers' competitiveness demonstrate a marginally significant negative effect (-0.211), while positive expectations lose significance. This implies that storage users—likely more risk-averse or heavily invested—are especially sensitive to potential market downturns. Moreover, a \textit{broader buyer network} retains a marginally significant, positive effect on storage duration (0.043), yet strategic motivations such as marketing and bargaining do not yield significant effects within this group. These differences suggest that dedicated storage users might be influenced by factors beyond our current model, including capacity, financing constraints, or established buyer relationships.
